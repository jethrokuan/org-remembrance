* org-remembrance

An attempt at Remembrance Agents, leveraging Org-mode and Recoll.
[[https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/remembrance_agents/][Here's a blog post describing it in more detail.]]

* General Blockers
- There's no way to easily all text globally (X Windows, Wayland or
  otherwise), closest we can get is through accessibility frameworks
  - hence, the attempt was limited to Emacs and Org-mode
- Keyword search doesn't return good results

* Ways Forward
- Incremental topic modelling on documents
